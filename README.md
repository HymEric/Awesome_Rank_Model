# Awesome_Rank_Model

The famous, classic and latest development of the ranking model in search, recommendation, and advertising. Mainly about CTR, CVR and other ranking model etc.

I try to classify each work carefully, but the mistake are inevitable because there are lots of overlaps in different field. Like the ctr and ranking or query-doc similarity are similar.
Hope this is  helpful for you and me. We find a special road-map for learning from this repo.  If you find any mistake, please don't hesitate to issue or pr. Thank you very much.
